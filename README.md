## Agile Methodology

I used Github issues to create User Stories. Then made a individual Milestone fro each individual feature to store all the User Stories related to that milestone. This agile approach methodology helps track the development of this project. You can find the User Stories [here](https://github.com/JoeYip13/project-5-drf-api-react/milestones)<br>
I created a Kanban board using Github Projects feature to track the flow of work from each milestone. You can find the Kanban board [here](https://github.com/users/JoeYip13/projects/7/views/1?groupedBy%5BcolumnId%5D=Milestone)

## Wireframes
I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to create wireframes. This was rough guideline of how I'd like to structure the website. But subject to changes during development stages.

## Typography
The logo was crafted using the "Sans Racing One" font from Google Fonts, chosen for its distinctive style. For the body text, the font "Arimo" was employed consistently throughout the website, ensuring a clean and readable presentation across various content sections.

## Colour Scheme

In selecting colors, my goal was to elevate the car posts to resemble an art gallery ambiance. To achieve this, I opted for a black main background color across the website, accompanied by white. Additionally, a contrasting touch of blue was introduced, while a subtle hint of red was strategically applied. The red accent serves as a focal point, particularly noticeable in heart and bookmark icons, adding visual interest and engagement cues.

## Reuable Components

A number of reusable React components were created with the intention of reducing code duplication.

#### `Avatar.js`

The Avatar Component in the Ultimate M Car project is a reusable UI element designed to display user profile pictures or any other relevant images in a visually appealing and consistent manner. This component is utilized across various sections of the project, such as NavBar, Posts, Comments, Events, and Reviews.

#### `Asset.js`

The Asset component is used to render the loading spinner utilised throughout the app.

#### `CustomAlert.js`

The Custom Alert component is used in the Sign In Form.

#### `MoreDropdown.js`

The MoreDropdown component is used to handle the Edit and Delete in Posts, Events, Comments, Reviews. This also is used for the Profile Edit Dropdown. Where the user can edit their profile, change username and password. 

#### `NavBar.js`

NavBar component is used in the App.js file which displays the NavBar throughout all the webpages.

#### `NotFound.js`

NotFound component is used to render a Not Found page.

## Features

### Like a Post
When a logged-in user expresses appreciation for a post by liking it, the "love heart" icon undergoes visual changes. Hovering over the icon alters the outline color, and upon clicking to like the post, the heart icon transitions to a solid color while the like count increments by 1. To undo the like, hovering over the heart icon changes the color from solid red to blue. Unliking the post reverts the icon to its original state, and the count decreases by 1. Users can conveniently access a list of all their liked posts through the profile dropdown menu by clicking on the "Liked" link.

### Bookmark a Event
When a logged-in user desires to bookmark an event, the "bookmark" icon undergoes visual transformations for a user-friendly experience. Hovering over the icon changes the outline color, and upon clicking to bookmark the event, the icon transitions to a solid color. Simultaneously, the bookmark count increases by 1. To remove the bookmark, hovering over the icon changes the color from solid red to blue. Unbookmarking the event reverts the icon to its original state, and the count decreases by 1. Users can conveniently access a compiled list of all their bookmarked events through the profile dropdown menu by clicking on the "Bookmarked" link.

### Review a Event
When a logged-in user intends to submit a review for an event, the process is streamlined for convenience. By hovering over the review icon on the main event page, the icon's outline transforms from a neutral grey to a solid black, clearly indicating its functionality as a link or call to action. Clicking on the icon directs the user straight to the desired event, revealing the review form below. The form includes a dropdown menu for selecting a star rating out of 5. Upon submission, users can easily review their contribution on the event and retain the option to edit or delete the review through the three dots menu. This user-friendly approach ensures a seamless and efficient review process.

### Search and filter Post
The search bar on the website functions as a versatile filtering tool for posts, enabling users to refine results based on various criteria. Posts can be filtered by username, title, model, year, BHP (brake horsepower), location, color, and a binary indicator for modifications ("Yes" or "No"). When a user inputs keywords into the search bar, any post containing matches for these criteria will be filtered and displayed, providing a tailored and efficient way to find specific content on the platform.

## Deployment and Initial Setup

This project was created using [Codeanywhere](https://www.codeanywhere.com/).

### Initial Setup

#### 1. Starting a React Project inside the DRF project

I followed Code Institute document found [here](https://code-institute-students.github.io/advfe-unified-workspace/creating-an-app-in-a-workspace/00-creating-an-app-in-a-workspace) for creating a new default React application in an existing DRF workspace.
- 1.1 Open the workspace for DRF project
- 1.2 Open the terminal window and create a new folder called frontend in the root directory

    `mkdir frontend`

- 1.3 Change directory to be inside the frontend folder with the following command

    `cd frontend`

- 1.4 From inside the frontend directory, run the following command to create a new React app and install all the working dependencies used in the Moments application

    `npx create-react-app . --template git+<https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/cra-template-moments.git> --use-npm`

- 1.5 Enter `y` to confirm and then click enter
- 1.6 Wait for all dependencies to be installed. This installation will take some time, the terminal may appear to freeze for a few minutes. Once it does start to show activity you can ignore any deprecated warnings, these are extremely common and expected with npm installs.
- Enter the following command to remove the .git folder, .gitignore file and README.md from the frontend folder as these already exist within the root directory of your DRF project

    `rm -rf .git .gitignore README.md`

- 1.7 From inside the frontend directory, run the following command to check that the basic React app is running

    `npm start`

- 1.8 Open the browser when the preview has finished building

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### 2. Preparing the Django API for development

- 2.1 In your `env.py` file, make the following changes:
- 2.2 Comment out the `DEV` environment variable. This ensures that the application will respond with JSON
- 2.3 Remove the CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV environment variable, if you have it
- 2.4 Add a new key DEBUG with a value of ‚Äò1‚Äô

    `os.environ['DEBUG'] = '1'`

- 2.5 Add a new key ALLOWED_HOST with the value of your development environment URL, wrapped in quotes. note to remove the `https://` from the beginning, and the trailing slash `/` from the end of the development environment URL.
- 2.6 Add a new key CLIENT_ORIGIN with the value of your development environment URL, wrapped in quotes. This string should include the `https://` at the beginning, but the trailing slash `/` should be removed.
- 2.7 If you are working in Codeanywhere you will need to install the urllib3 package to ensure your post images will save to Cloudinary without errors.
- 2.8 Ensure your terminal location is in the root directory, then install urllib3 with the following command

    `pip3 install urllib3==1.26.15`

- 2.9 Add this dependency to your requirements.txt file with the following command

    `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### 3. Updating `settings.py`

Now that we have the two parts of our application within the same workspace, the CORS issues with the original separate projects are no longer a problem. This is because both parts of the project will come from the same base URL. Therefore, we can remove most of the code in the Django project relating to CORS.

- 3.1 In `settings.py` Set DEBUG to the value of the DEBUG environment variable and update ALLOWED_HOSTS to include the ALLOWED_HOST environment variable added to your `env.py` file
- 3.2 In your `settings.py` file remove the line containing the `import re`
- 3.3 Remove all the CORS code, leaving only the CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS list. Should look like this:

    `if 'CLIENT_ORIGIN' in os.environ:`<br>
    `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [`<br>
        `os.environ.get('CLIENT_ORIGIN')`<br>
    `]`<br>
    `CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS = True`<br>

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### 4. Preparing React to connect to the Django API

- 4.1 Open the package.json file in the frontend directory, and at the bottom of the file, add a new key to the JSON object

    `"proxy": "http://localhost:8000/"`

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### 5. Deployment of both application

Because the React part of the project contains static files, we need to store all the static files for deployment, using WhiteNoise. WhiteNoise will also store the static files for the Django Admin panel, so you‚Äôll be able to easily access that from the deployed URL as well.

- 5.1 In the terminal: Ensure your terminal location is in the root directory, then install whitenoise with the following command

    `pip3 install whitenoise==6.4.0`

- 5.2 Add this dependency to your requirements.txt file with the following command

    `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`

- 5.3 Create a new empty folder called staticfiles in the root directly with the following command

    `mkdir staticfiles`

- 5.4 In `settings.py` In the INSTALLED_APPS list, ensure that the ‚Äòcloudinary_storage‚Äô app name is below ‚Äòdjango.contrib.staticfiles‚Äô. This ensures that Cloudinary will not attempt to intervene with staticfiles, and allows whitenoise to become the primary package responsible for static files

- 5.5 In the MIDDLEWARE list, add WhiteNoise below the SecurityMiddleware and above the SessionMiddleware

    `'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',`

- 5.6 In the TEMPLATES list at the DIRS key, add the following code to the DIRS list, to tell Django and WhiteNoise where to look for Reacts index.html file in deployment

    `'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles', 'build')],`

- 5.7 In the static files section, add the STATIC_ROOT and WHITENOISE_ROOT variables and values to tell Django and WhiteNoise where to look for the admin static files and Reacts static files during deployment

    `WHITENOISE_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles' / 'build'`
